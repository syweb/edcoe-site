  <h1>About Edcoe</h1>
  <p>El Dorado County Office of Education invites students, parents, educators and the 
  community to learn more about our services, programs, opportunities and innovations in
  our commitment to prepare our students for future success. EDCOE’s goal is to deliver 
  educational excellence through responsible cost-effective centralized services to meet 
  regulatory and educational standards in a safe, successful educational environment for 
  all of our children… our most precious asset.

    Our service area covers all of El Dorado County. It is a diverse county, covering 
    metropolitan suburbs of Sacramento to rural foothill communities on up the western 
    slope of the Sierra Nevada Mountains to beautiful Lake Tahoe. Country roads off 
    Highway 50 can lead you through urban suburbs, rich agricultural or recreational land. 
    The developing wine country draws visitors and awards for its wines. Visits to Apple 
    Hill’s orchards, craft fairs and tree farms are poplar harvest traditions. The western 
    slope of the Sierras is home to the El Dorado National Forest, famous for the off‐road 
    vehicle Rubicon Trail. This mountain area provides skiing, hiking, camping, boating and 
    fishing as well as supports the logging industry.

  <p>It is EDCOE’s pleasure to serve its students and community in our wonderful county.</p>
