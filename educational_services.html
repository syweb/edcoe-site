  <h1>Educational Services</h1>
  <h5><i>Educational Services is dedicated to providing educational excellence to prepare every student for success in their individual role to meet the challenges of tomorrow’s society.</i></h5>
  <h2>Preparing for the 21st Century</h2>  
  
  <p>The foundation for success in the 21st century will be the ability to think critically, solve problems creatively, and to communicate and collaborate effectively. Common Core State Standards will provide opportunities for students to acquire and perfect these “21st century skills” so they can be prepared to succeed in higher education and compete in the global economy.</p>
