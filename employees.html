  <h5><i>EDCOE strives to support employees as well as students</i></h5>
  <p>I look forward to sharing the creative potential of change with you.</p>
  <p>Your personal contributions have created EDCOEâ€™s legacy of being a service organization to our community, our children and families, our districts and most of all, to each other.</p>
  <p>By working collaboratively, we surround ourselves with new ways to solve issues and break out of standard routines.</p>
  <p>My goal is to be the best steward of the faith that the County Board, the community and EDCOE staff have placed in me. I am thoroughly excited to serve as your County Superintendent and I look forward to the great work we can do together.  </p>
  
  <p>Sincerely,<br>
