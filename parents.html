<h5><i>Parents and families play an important role in student success. EDCOE provides these resources to strengthen the 
bond between home and school.</i></h5>

<p>EDCOE provides services, administration and infrastructure as a partner with parents for a variety of education programs.  Included in our service offerings are child development programs for young children 0-5 years of age which promote the well-being of the whole child to prepare them for school. For school age children, EDCOE operates a variety of alternative programs for student enrichment and for students with special needs. In addition to the school day, services include extended day childcare providing high quality educational activities. </p>
