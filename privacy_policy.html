<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
<h5><i>Web Content Disclaimer and Privacy Information</i></h5>

<p>By visiting this Web site, you are accepting the policies and practices described in this notice.</p>
<p>Please note that this Use Policy is subject to change without notice and that it reflects El Dorado County Office of Education’s (EDCOE) current business practices.</p>

<h2>Personal Information and Choice</h2>
<p>"Personal information" is information about a person that identifies or describes an individual, including, but not limited to, his or her name, social security number, physical description, home address, home telephone number, education, financial matters, and medical or employment history, readily identifiable to that specific individual. An Internet Protocol (IP) address is not considered personal information; however, it is considered "electronically collected personal information."</p>
<p>"Electronically collected personal information" we automatically collect includes your computer’s (or network’s) IP address and statistical information about which Web pages you visit. If you voluntarily participate in an activity that asks for specific information (e.g., completing a request for assistance, personalizing the content of the Web site, sending an e-mail, or participating in a survey), more detailed data will be collected. If you choose not to participate in these activities, your choice will in no way affect your ability to use any other feature of the Web site.</p>
<p>If any type of personal information is requested on the Web site or volunteered by the user, state law, including Information Practices Act of 1977, and the federal Privacy Act of 1974, may protect it. However, this information may be a public record once you provide it and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not otherwise protected by federal or state law.</p>

<h2>A Special Note About Children</h2>
<p>Children under the age of 13 are not eligible to use services that require submission of personal information and we require that minors (under the age of 13) do not submit any personal information to us. This includes submitting personal information to EDCOE as part of a user profile or personalization profile. If you are a minor, you can use these services only if used together with your parents or guardians. If you are a minor, you should seek guidance from your parents.</p>
<p>If EDCOE decides to begin collecting personal information from children, it will notify parents that it is being requested, disclose the reasons for collecting it, and disclose our intended use for it. EDCOE will seek parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information. If it does collect it, parents may request information on the type of data being collected, view their child's information and, if they choose, prohibit EDCOE from making further use of their child's information. EDCOE will not provide personal information about children to third parties.</p>

<h2>Information Collected and How it is Used</h2>
<p>We do collect personal information directly from individuals who volunteer to use some of our services. Collection of this information is required to deliver the specific services, but use of these services is voluntary.</p>
<p>EDCOE may provide or distribute certain lists and statistical reports of regulatory information as provided by law, but no personal information is sold or distributed and all relevant legal protections still apply to the EDCOE Web site.</p>
<p>If you do nothing during your visit to the Web site but browse or download information, we automatically collect and store the following information about your visit:</p>

  <li>The type of web browser and operating system you used.</li>
  <li>The date and time you visited this site.</li>
  <li>The Web pages or services you accessed at this site.</li>

  <li>If you downloaded a form, the form that was downloaded.</li>
</ol>
<p>The information we automatically collect or store is used to improve the content of our Web services and to help us understand how people are using our services. This information does not identify you personally and is used for gathering Web site statistics. The information we automatically collect and store in our logs about your visit helps us to analyze our Web site to continually improve the value of the materials available. Our Web site logs do not identify a visitor by personal information, and we make no attempt to link other Web sites with the individuals who browse EDCOE's Web site.</p>
<p>EDCOE does not sell any "electronically collected personal information." Any distribution of "electronically collected personal information" will be solely for the purposes for which it was \provided to us.</p>

<h2>What Happens to Information You Submit to Us?</h2>
<p>If you choose to submit information to us, any private information will be used only for the purposes for which it was provided and will not be shared with another entity, except as prescribed by law.</p>

<h2>If You Send Us Email</h2>
<p>You may choose to provide us with personal information, as in an e-mail, with a comment or question. We use the information to improve our service to you or to respond to your request. Sometimes we forward your e-mail to other employees who may be better able to help you, and this staff may be employed by a different department within EDCOE. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations or as required by law, we do not share our e-mail with any other organizations.</p>
<p>We use your e-mail to respond appropriately. This may be to respond to you, to address issues you identify, to further improve our web site, or to forward the e-mail to another department for appropriate action.</p>

<h2>Order Forms</h2>
<p>If you place an order with us, we request information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill your order/request. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with you.</p>

<h2>Public Disclosure</h2>
<p>In the State of California, laws exist to ensure that government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by state government. At the same time, there are exceptions to the public's right to access public records. These exceptions serve various needs, including maintaining the privacy of individuals. Both state and federal laws provide exceptions.</p>
<p>All information collected at this site becomes public record that may be subject to inspection and copying by the public, unless an exemption in law exists. In the event of a conflict between this Use Policy and the Public Records Act, the Information Practices Act, or other law governing the disclosure of records, the Public Records Act, the Information Practices Act, or other applicable law will control.</p>
