They deserve a quality education in safe, caring schools by highly qualified and motivated staff committed to excellence and service. My adult life as a teacher and a school, district, and El Dorado County Office of Education administrator has been devoted to the idea that our children come first. In my role as El Dorado County Superintendent, the education of our children continues to be my primary goal - both how well they are cared for today and how well that care prepares them for future challenges. The future of our country rests in our children - their education is our greatest responsibility. We are committed to working hard for our children by seeking to find the best teachers, assisting in building more and better schools, and developing stronger partnerships with government, private industry, community-based organizations, and small businesses. We are accountable to our clients, not only in providing a quality education for our youth, but also in maintaining sound management practices and care in how we spend your tax dollars. I am pleased that all El Dorado County Districts are dedicated to these same goals.</p>
    <p>Recently, the unprecedented economic downturn has threatened our ability to maintain the high level of quality education our children deserve. We have seen some signs that the economy is recovering; however, there is still uncertainty and growth is slow. While we recognize California's financial challenges, recent state budgets have resulted in catastrophic reductions to public education; ranking California's spending per pupil lower than all other states in the nation. In 2012, thankfully, the voters of California helped to mitigate the need for further reductions and set schools on a healthier fiscal path by passing Proposition 30. While Proposition 30 does not resolve the inadequacy of school finance in the state of California, it is certainly a step in the right direction.</p>
    <p>Governor Jerry Brown is committed to a fundamental overhaul of school finance through the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF). The intent of LCFF is to more equitably distribute school finances by consolidating nearly all categorical programs into a new "base" revenue limit for elementary, unified, and secondary school districts. In addition to base revenues, LCFF proposes supplement and concentration funds for districts who serve students identified as English Language Learners (ELL), socio-economically disadvantaged (SES), and/or foster youth. As of this publication, there are a great many questions around LCFF and specifics continue to be refined. The impacts of LCFF on the County Office and our districts have the potential to be profound – clearly we are committed to tracking these developments and advocating on behalf of El Dorado County students and families.</p>
    <p>We look forward to a rich and rewarding year.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,<br>
